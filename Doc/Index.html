<h1>About</h1>
<p><i>Rick Ardurous</i> is a game developed by Alban Nanty for the Arduboy, and inspired by the retro-game <i>Rick Dangerous</i>, where the player takes the role of an adventurer exploring caves in the hope of finding the Grail. The game propose a series of puzzles fitting in one screen. The player will have to reach the exit point of each screen to move to the next puzzle. The game propose 12 puzzle-screens with an increasing difficulty.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>Git Repo</h2>
<p><i>Rick Ardurous</i> is open source. The repository is located here: <a href="https://github.com/Lswbanban/RickArdurous">https://github.com/Lswbanban/RickArdurous</a>. After cloning the repository you will find several folders:
<ul>
	<li>The base folder contains all the source files of the game. You should open the <b>RickArdurous.ino</b> file in the Arduino IDE if you want to recompile the game.</li>
	<li>The <b>Release</b> folder contains the last compiled version of the Editor, as well as the packed version of the game. This is were you should go if you don't want to modify and recompile the game, but just play.</li>
	<li>The <b>Doc</b> folder contains this documentation.</li>
	<li>The <b>image</b> folder contains the images that were used to create the game (but they are not required for the game to run). These images are also used by the Level Editor.</li>
	<li>The <b>RickArdurousEditor</b> folder contains the source files of the editor, written in C# with Visual Studio on Windows.</li>
	<li>The <b>Publishing</b> folder contains all the files needed to create a packed version of the game.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>If you want to modify and recompile the game, you can open the <b>RickArdurous.ino</b> file located in the base folder, with the Arduino IDE. Otherwise if you just want to launch the game as it is with a game launcher, you can open the <b>RickArdurous.arduboy</b> file located in the <b>Release</b> folder.</p>

<h2>The Level Editor</h2>
<p>After cloning the repository, to launch the Level editor on Windows platform, run the <b>RickArdurousEditor.exe</b> executable located in the <b>Release</b> folder. If you change the folder structure, the editor will have trouble to reads the files located in the parent folder and in the <b>image</b> folder, however you can change those paths in the Preferences of the Editor (through the <i>File &gt; Preferences...</i> menu).</p>

<h1>Level Editor</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The main window of the Editor is split in several panels which size can be adjusted. Refer to the sceenshot and the list below to learn more about the functionality of each panel:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The panel (1) lists all the 16 possible sprites for the background of the map. You should select the sprite that you want to draw on the map, from this panel.</li>
	<li>The panel (2) lists all the available items that can be placed in each puzzle screen. You should select the item you want to add on the map before clicking on the map.</li>
	<li>The panel (3) contains the whole map of the game. It is split by puzzle screen with blue separator lines. The top left screen display the Game Main Menu for reference (see <i>Level Design Tips</i> chapter below for more details).</li>
	<li>The panel (4) is a log window, it displays information and warnings when necessary.</li>
</ul>
<img src="PanelOverview.png" class="center">

<p>The toolbar contains 4 buttons which are (from left to right):</p>
<ul>
	<li>The mirror button: used to mirror some items.</li>
	<li>The item state button: used to change the state of some items.</li>
	<li>The delete item button: used to delete the selected item.</li>
	<li>The draw puzzle path button: toggle the display of the puzzle path, as the editor computed it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mouse Navigation</h2>

<p><b>Panning and Zooming:</b> You can use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out. Then you can click on the mouse wheel and move the mouse to pan the view (once zoomed in).</p>

<p><b>Background Editing:</b> First select a background sprite in panel (1), then click with the <b>Right Mouse Button</b> on the map panel (3), to set the background sprite at the clicked position. If you want to delete a sprite, you need to select the empty sprite (the last sprite) on the panel (1), then use the <b>Right Mouse Button</b> on the map panel (3). Note that some sprite will randomly be mirrored once placed on the map, and you cannot control it. The random algorithm depends on the coordinate of the sprite, and is the same in the editor than in the game, so you should see the same background in the editor and in the game. Some other sprites are mirrored depeding on their neighbors: the sprite 7 and 8 will be mirrored if there's an empty sprite on their left, and the big statue sprites (9 and 10) will be mirrored if there's the same sprite on their left.</p>

<p><b>Item Editing:</b> First select a sprite in the item panel (2), then click with the <b>Left Mouse Button</b> on an empty spot of the map panel (3) to add a sprite. If you click with the <b>Left Mouse Button</b> on an existing sprite on the map panel (3), it will select this sprite instead of adding a new one. The selected sprite will be surrounded with a yellow frame. If you want to add an item very close to an existing one, add it first in an empty spot, then move it. You can move an item by selecting it, and drag'n'dropping it on the map panel (3) with the left mouse button. For precise item positioning, zoom in the map with the mouse wheel before moving the item. If you want to delete an item, first select it, then press the "Del" or "Backspace" key, or click on the red cross in the toolbar.</p>

<h2>Item Mirroring</h2>

<p>Some items can be mirrored, which has various effects in the game. To mirror an item, first select it on the map panel (3), then click on the mirror button in the toolbar. To un-mirror an item, click again on the mirror button in the toolbar. Here are the effects of mirroring for the various items:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Rick Spawn point: This has no effect so far (because it is currently not implemented in the game engine), but ideally it should orientate Rick in the correct direction after a respawn.</li>
	<li>Green Bonuses: Mirror has no effect.</li>
	<li>Vertical spike: Mirror will display the spike pointing downward.</li>
	<li>Horizontal spike: Mirror will display the spike pointing to the right.</li>
	<li>Yellow enemies: Mirror will spawn the enemies oriented to the left, which means they will start moving to the left after spawning.</li>
	<li>Stalagmite and Stalactite: Mirror has no effect.</li>
	<li>Arrow Launcher: Mirror will display the arrow launcher face looking to the left, which means it will launch its arrows to the left.</li>
	<li>Destroyable Block: Mirror has no effect.</li>
	<li>Rolling Boulder: Mirror will spawn the boulder oriented to the left, which means it will start rolling to the left after spawning.</li>	
</ul>

<h2>Item State</h2>

<p>Two items, the Rick Spawn point and the Rolling Boulder can have 2 states, denoted by a bright or dark color. You can switch their state by first selecting the item, then clicking on the item state button in the toolbar, which will change the brightness of the item to denote its state.</p>

<p><b>Rick Spawn point</b>: You must have one and only one bright Rick Spawn Point in your map: this will be the initial spawn point of the game. Then every other Rick Spawn Point (the darker version) are intermediate checkpoints. You will get an error if you try to save your map without a bright Rick Spawn Point, or if you have more than one in your map.</p>

<p><b>Rolling Boulder</b>: The bright rolling boulder will spawn in a rolling state. Otherwise the dark rolling boulder will spawn without moving. The player will have to use a dynamite to make the boulder roll.</p>

<h2>Arrow Launcher distance</h2>

<p>If you place an arrow launcher item on the map (the magenta face) you will see that a magenta frame is also displayed. This box represents the sensor distance of the arrow launcher. Whenever Rick or an enemy enter in this rectangle, it will launches its arrow. You can adjust this distance by first selecting the arrow launcher item, then moving your mouse over the sensor extremity and drag'n'droping the extremity to resize the sensor box.</p>

<h1>Level Design Tips</h1>

<h2>The Special Main Menu Puzzle Screen</h2>

<p>For optimization reason, the Game will use the top left puzzle screen as background for the Main Menu. This is why the editor display the 3 menu items of the main menu on this corner. You can dedicate this puzzle screen to the main menu, but you can also reuse it in the game flow by integrating it in the puzzle path (see next chapter). However when this puzzle screen is used in the Main Menu, all the items except the stalagmites, the stalactites and Rick are ignored. Also a black square background is drawn under the text of the Main Menu for clarity.</p>

<h2>Puzzle Path</h2>

<p>In order to be saved, your map need to create an non-branching linear puzzle path. This means each puzzle screen must have connection(s) to only 2 neighbors. You can have multiple gate from one screen to the same neighbor, but a screen cannot have gates to 3 or 4 differents neighbors. The gate can be as large as you want, you can leave the whole edge empty if you wish. However, it is recommended to add a background sprite in each corner because a corner can connect to two different neighbors. Said differently, that means two edges of each puzzle screen must be completely filled with background sprites.</p>

<p>On top of respecting the puzzle path constraint, you also need to specify a starting point, and a ending point. The starting point is specified with a bright Rick Spawn Point item (add this item on the map and click on the item state button in the toolbar to make it bright) and the ending point is specified with the grail item. There can only have one bright Rick Spawn Point and one Grail item in the map. The Editor will try to follow a path between these two specific items, follwing the connections between the puzzle screens. To visualize the path found by the editor, click on the draw puzzle screen path button in the toolbar.</p>

<h2>The Static Collision Sprites</h2>

<p>The map are created by placing 8x8 pixels sprites on a grid. The grid of a puzzle screen contains 16 sprites horizontaly and 8 sprites verticaly. However, only two pixels of the last line of sprites will be visible. This is because the whole puzzle screen is shifted downward by 6 pixels, in order to display the HUD on top of the screen. But those 2 visible pixels of the last line can still be used to create a walking platform for the player. Also this last line of sprite will be quickly displayed in its entirety during a vertical transition of the camera, when the player enter into a new puzzle screen above or below.</p>

<p>The game only offer 15 sprites + one special sprite for the empty space (the last one). There are basically 3 families of sprites: the rocky one, the stone one, and the platform one. Here is a description of the sprites:</p>

Their speed is faster than Mummy. They can jump off platforms. They will stop moving only if they are blocked by a collision, or if they are aligned horizontaly with the player (above or under the player). They can trigger traps such as Stalactite and Arrow Launcher. They can be killed by bullets, arrows, dynamites, Stalagmites, Stalactites, Spikes, and Rolling Boulders.</td>

They do not jump off platforms, but will turn around if they reach the end of the platform. They do not trigger traps such as Stalactite and Arrow Launcher. They can be killed by dynamites, Stalagmites, Stalactites, Spikes, and Rolling Boulders. Theorically they could be killed by bullets and arrows, but since they are small, the bullet flies over their head when the player shoot and the player cannot shoot while jumping (which is the intended behavior). If you place an Arrow Launcher close to the ground it may hit a Scorpion, but again, the intended behavior is to have the arrow flying above the scorpion. The expected behavior for the player is to kill the Scorpion with a dynamite, or with a trap.</td>

Trap triggerers are: the player, the Mummy, the Skeleton and the Rolling Boulder. The player, ennemies (all 3 types) and Stalagmites will die if they are hit by the Stalactite. The boulder will not die if it is hit by a Stalactite.</td>

The Arrow Launcher will launch an arrow from the mouth of the facial statue. You can mirror this item to make it fire its arrow in the other direction. Once you place an arrow launcher on the map, you can select it to adjust its trigger zone. To avoid incomprehension of the player, you should extend the trigger zone up to the collision, however, it is possible to create a shorter trigger zone. Once the Arrow launcher hase launched its arrow, there is a reloading time, before the second arrow is launched. Trap triggerers are: the player, the Mummy, the Skeleton and the Rolling Boulder.</td>

		<td class="itemDesc">820 bytes<br/>+60 bytes/instance</td>
		<td class="itemDesc">This item has two state. If placed on the map on the bright state, it will be spawn in the game in a rolling state, otherwise, the dark state boulder will be spawn immobile. You can mirror this item to change its rolling direction, it will roll in the direction where the shadow is drawn on the boulder. If you place a immobile boulder in the map, the player can make it move by placing a dynamite next to it. After the explosion of the dynamite, the boulder will move in the opposite direction of the dynamite. An immobile boulder is not dangerous for the player and ennemies, the player can jump on it, and the ennemies will be blocked by it. However a rolling boulder will kill the player and the enemies. A rolling boulder can fall off platform, but will stop rolling if it hits a collision, it will then become an immobile boulder.</td>

<h2>Game Size Optimization</h2>

<p><b>Item Optimization:</b> The game engine will reuse the instances of the items in between the puzzle screen, which means if you place an enemy in screen one, and an enemy in screen two, the game engine will actually only use one enemy instance to save memory. However if you place 5 enemies in the same puzzle screen, then 5 instances must be created. You should then think of a budget number for each type of item that you want to use in one screen. The three yellow type of enemies can share the same instance, and the 2 red spikes also, but not the 4 green bonuses.</p>

<p><b>Background Optimization:</b> The background sprites are compressed using a custom RLE algorithm. Only the space (empty sprite) are packed, the other sprites are not. Therefore drawing big empty caves will take less memory that narrow tunels.</p>
