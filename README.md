Rick Ardurous

# What is it

Rick Ardurous is an attempt to clone the famous old Rick Dangerous on the Arduboy platform.

# Bug list
- Bug with death trajectory

# To do

## Enemy

# New items to come
- The destroyable blocks (with the dynamite to create a path)
- The destroyable stalagmites that block the way (destroyable with the dynamite)
- A falling item, like a stalagtite (similar to the falling grill in the original game)
- The rolling boulder
- And I don't want to do the trigger + moving platform. But we can have trigger plate + door or trigger plate + boulder.
- And I don't like the bat, so I don't want it (fire do not kill it, but make it move, this is not logical)?
