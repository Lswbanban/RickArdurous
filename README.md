Rick Ardurous

# What is it

Rick Ardurous is an attempt to clone the famous old Rick Dangerous on the Arduboy platform.

# Bug list

# To do
- add a new sprite to use the arrow launcher slot
- The main menu
	- Sound on/off
	- Help/display controls?
- Sound/LED FX
	- Jump
	- For Rick Death
	- different sound for picking crate/statuette/graal
- Music ?

# New items to come
- The rolling boulder
- And I don't want to do the trigger + moving platform. But we can have trigger plate + door or trigger plate + boulder.
- And I don't like the bat, so I don't want it (fire do not kill it, but make it move, this is not logical)?
