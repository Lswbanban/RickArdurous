Rick Ardurous

# What is it

Rick Ardurous is an attempt to clone the famous old Rick Dangerous on the Arduboy platform.

# Bug list

# To do
- Move the remove of the item inside the MapManager when the update return true

## Enemy
- Implement the logic for the Skeleton to wait and follow Rick
- Implement the respawn update step

# New items to come
- The destroyable blocks (with the dynamite to create a path)
- The destroyable stalagmites that block the way (destroyable with the dynamite)
- A falling item, like a stalagtite (similar to the falling grill in the original game)
- The rolling boulder
- A scorpion as a new type of Enemy (this cannot be killed by the bullet, because too short). But need to define the AI logic, to see if it is interesting.
- And I don't want to do the trigger + moving platform. But we can have trigger plate + door or trigger plate + boulder.
- And I don't like the bat, so I don't want it (fire do not kill it, but make it move, this is not logical)?
